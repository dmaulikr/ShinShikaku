# ShinShikaku 
*an ambitious puzzle game for iOS*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NiceThings/FlubberView.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/NiceThings/ShinShikaku)

-------------

### Requirements
* Xcode 9 beta 5
* Carthage 0.24.0


### Quick Setup
Shin Shikaku uses [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for dependency management.  To get started, install Carthage via `Homebrew`:

```brew install carthage```


and pull down `RxSwift`, `Quick` and `Nimble`, by running:

```
carthage update --platform iOS
```

this might take a little while. Once dependencies are installed you're ready to build the app and start contributing.


### Project Management
Shin Shikaku organizes and prioritizes work in this [project](https://github.com/NiceThings/ShinShikaku/projects/1).  We embrace a pared-down flavor of scrum (2-week sprints, weekly standups, sprint planning/work allocation following the conclusion of each sprint), and tickets can be created by adding a `note` from the backlog, converting it to an `issue`, and assigning that issue to a collaborator.

### Continuous Integration
Shin Shikaku uses [Travis CI](travis-ci.org/NiceThings/ShinShikaku) for continuous integration.

### Design
Comps are located in the `Design` directory and can be opened using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
